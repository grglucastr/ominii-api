1.  **Install via npm:**

Download and install all dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
  
2.  **Configure the port**

By default it runs on port 3000, but you can edit the file

```

```bash
server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 3000')
})
``` 

3.  **Run the API:**
```bash
npm start

```
## <a name="db"></a>Database

For this project, we are using NoSQL (MongoDB) to store the tweets. The database is located in a Cloud Storage Service provided by [MLab](https://mlab.com).

We are also using [Mongoose ORM](https://mongoosejs.com/) to handle database transactions.

### <a name="db-config"></a>Database Configuration

Assuming you're using Mongoose,  can configure the database by accessing the ``` src/index.js ```
 and editing the following line and pass your configuration
```
mongoose.connect('mongodb://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>', {
  useNewUrlParser:  true
})
```

## <a name="routes"></a>API Routes

All the routes are setted on the ```src/routes.js``` . In overall, the routes are self-descriptive. 

| Route | Description |
| :----- | :----: |
| ```GET /tweets ``` | Lists all the tweets stored on database |
| ```POST /tweets ``` | Post a new tweet to the database |
| ```POST /likes/:id ``` | Increments the like counter for certain tweet. The tweet is passed on the URL by the ```:id``` param |
